The goal of this lab was to complete the Try Hack Me room "Introductory Networking."  The room starts by giving a brief intro to the objectives of the room which are 
to explain the OSI model, encapsulation, the TCP/IP model, followed by a collection of linux network information and troubleshooting tools.  Finally, the room ends with
some suggested reading to get more practice for the subject I found encapsulation to be a pretty enlightening topic in particular.  The process is actually both quite 
simple. The first three sections each explain the topic then follow with quiz questions on each topic.  The networking tools sections each explain a particular linux 
tool, then have you find or try out different functions or commands by asking about how they work.  Examples of this are restricting ping requests to IPv4 with the -4
command, specifying an interface on trace route with the -i command, or even asking about where your computer would first look to find a domain's IP address.
